# DreamSprout Story Generator

**DreamSprout** is a fun, educational Python app that transforms a few words into a fully illustrated storybook using local large language models (via Ollama) and image generation (via Stable Diffusion XL).

It began with a familiar morning moment: waking up and wondering, “What was that dream about?” **DreamSprout** turns those hazy, half-remembered fragments into surreal and unexpectedly delightful stories.

Because of the quirky nature of language and diffusion models, the results are funny and often veer into nonsense. It's fun, not just for children but for AI geeks who wish to test various open weight models and see their different characteristics. It's a storytelling tool AND an educational sandbox for AI enthusiasts.

**Because DreamSprout runs entirely on your local computer, no cloud, no cost, no Internet required, and your privacy is protected.**

## Features

- **Model choices**: User can choose local Ollama models (e.g., `llama3.1`, `mistral`). This can be a fun experiment to see different characteristics of open weight models. Models must be installed locally. 
- **Scene Splitting**: Automatically segments stories into scenes and builds image prompts.
- **Image Generation**: Uses HuggingFace diffusers with SDXL to illustrate each scene.
- **Web App**: Flask-based UI for interactive story creation and gallery browsing.
- **HTML Output**: Generates a stylized, child-friendly storybook with prompts, models, and timestamps.
- **CLI Mode**: Run the full pipeline from the command line for testing or automation.
- **Configurable**: Story length and styles can be configured for a variety of storytelling potential.

## Requirements and setup

Virtual environment is strongly recommended when installing any Python packages.
<pre>
python -m venv .venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate
</pre>

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**`requirements.txt`**
```
torch==2.9.0
numpy==2.2.6
diffusers==0.35.2
transformers==4.57.1
accelerate==1.12.0
safetensors==0.7.0
huggingface-hub==0.36.0
xformers==0.0.33.post1

Jinja2==3.1.6
requests==2.32.5
```

### Install Ollama and pull your local model

<pre>
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
ollama serve
ollama pull mistral (or whatever models you want)
</pre>

## Usage

### CLI (for testing)

```bash
python dreamsprout.py --prompt "description of your dream here" --elements "a few keywords separated by commas here"
```

This will generate a story, split it into scenes, create illustrations, and render an HTML storybook in `outputs/`.

### Web App

```bash
export FLASK_APP=dreamsprout_webapp.py
flask run
```

Then open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser to:

- Enter a story prompt
- Select a text model
- View and download your generated storybook
